## Suites Directory

This directory defines the testing suites availible to test different models by different tuning techniques.


### Testing Catagories

There are some different types of tests to be done on different models.  
They're split on the lines of Accuracy, Latency, and Comprehensive tests.
At the present moment, only consider comprehensive tests which test accuracy and latency.
The other tests to stress only accuarcy or latency are not implemented.

#### Source and Case

The source contains implementations of different tests, and the cases run the test for different models per file.
