INSUFFICIENT
To generate an SQL statement to answer the question, we need to know the database schema and the specific table where the data is stored. However, since we don't have that information, we can provide a general SQL statement that can be used to calculate the year-on-year change in GRAPI.

Assuming we have a table named "rent_data" with columns "year", "grapi", and "household_income", we can use the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT 
    year,
    (grapi_current - grapi_previous) / grapi_previous * 100 AS year_on_year_change
FROM 
    (
        SELECT 
            year,
            grapi,
            household_income,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY year ORDER BY year) AS row_num
        FROM 
            rent_data
    ) AS subquery
WHERE 
    row_num = 2;
```

This SQL statement calculates the year-on-year change in GRAPI by comparing the current year's GRAPI with the previous year's GRAPI. The result is expressed as a percentage of the previous year's GRAPI.

Please provide the database schema and the specific table where the data is stored if you need a more accurate SQL statement.

If more information is required, simply respond with 'INSUFFICENT'.

INSUFFICIENT
To generate an SQL statement to answer the question, we need more information about the database schema and the specific tables involved. However, based on the prompt, we can assume that we have two tables: `rent` and `house_value`, which contain the rent and value of houses for each zip code.

Assuming the tables have the following structure:

rent table:
- zip_code (integer)
- year (integer)
- rent (decimal)

house_value table:
- zip_code (integer)
- year (integer)
- value (decimal)

The SQL statement to answer the question would be:

```sql
SELECT zip_code, AVG(rent) AS average_rent, AVG(value) AS average_value
FROM rent
JOIN house_value ON rent.zip_code = house_value.zip_code
GROUP BY zip_code;
```

This statement joins the `rent` and `house_value` tables on the `zip_code` column, groups the results by `zip_code`, and calculates the average rent and average value for each zip code.

To generate an SQL statement to answer the question, we need to know the database schema and the table structure. However, since you haven't provided any information about the database or the table structure, I can only provide a general SQL statement that can be used to calculate the average house price for each zip code in a given year.

Assuming you have a table named "houses" with columns "zip_code" and "price" representing the zip code and house price respectively, and a table named "years" with a column "year" representing the year, you can use the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT zip_code, AVG(price) AS average_price
FROM houses
JOIN years ON houses.year = years.year
GROUP BY zip_code, year;
```

This SQL statement joins the "houses" and "years" tables based on the year column. It then calculates the average price for each zip code and year using the AVG() function and groups the results by zip code and year.

INSUFFICIENT
To generate an SQL statement to answer the question, we need to know the structure of the database and the specific tables involved. However, since we don't have that information, we can provide a general SQL statement that can be used to calculate the percentage of Blacks with respect to the total population in each zipcode for the year 2022.

Assuming we have a table named "population" with columns "zipcode", "year", "total_population", and "black_population", the SQL statement would be:

```sql
SELECT zipcode, (black_population / total_population) * 100 AS percentage
FROM population
WHERE year = 2022;
```

This statement selects the zipcode and calculates the percentage of Blacks with respect to the total population for the year 2022. The result will be the zipcode and the percentage of Blacks in each zipcode.

INSUFFICIENT
To generate an SQL statement to answer the question, we need to know the structure of the database and the specific tables that contain the required information. However, since we don't have that information, we can provide a general SQL statement that can be used to calculate the percentage of Hispanics/Latinos with respect to the total population in each zipcode for the year 2022.

Assuming we have two tables: "zipcode" and "population", where "zipcode" contains the zipcode and "population" contains the total population for each zipcode, we can use the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT zipcode, (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ethnicity = 'Hispanic/Latino') * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage
FROM zipcode
WHERE YEAR(date) = 2022
GROUP BY zipcode;
```

This SQL statement selects the zipcode and calculates the percentage of Hispanics/Latinos with respect to the total population for each zipcode in the year 2022. The `COUNT(*)` function is used to count the number of rows with the ethnicity 'Hispanic/Latino', and the `COUNT(*)` function is used to count the total number of rows. The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the rows based on the ethnicity. The `WHERE` clause is used to filter the rows based on the year. Finally, the `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by zipcode.

To generate an SQL statement to answer the question, we need to know the structure of the database tables and the specific columns that contain the required information. However, since the prompt does not provide this information, it is impossible to generate an accurate SQL statement without additional details.

Please provide the necessary information, such as the table names, column names, and the specific data you want to retrieve.

To generate an SQL statement to answer the question, we need to know the structure of the database tables and the specific columns that contain the required information. However, since we don't have that information, we can provide a general SQL statement that can be used to retrieve the required data.

Assuming we have two tables: `zipcodes` and `citizenship_data`, where `zipcodes` contains the zipcode information and `citizenship_data` contains the citizenship and foreign born population information.

Here's a general SQL statement that can be used to retrieve the count of non-US citizens and foreign born population for each zipcode in Georgia:

```sql
SELECT zipcode, COUNT(CASE WHEN citizenship <> 'US' THEN 1 END) AS non_us_citizens, COUNT(CASE WHEN foreign_born = 'Yes' THEN 1 END) AS foreign_born_population
FROM zipcodes
JOIN citizenship_data ON zipcodes.zipcode = citizenship_data.zipcode
WHERE state = 'Georgia'
GROUP BY zipcode;
```

Please replace `zipcodes` and `citizenship_data` with the actual table names in your database. Also, make sure to adjust the column names and conditions according to your specific database schema.

Here is the SQL statement to answer the question:

```sql
SELECT zipcode, AVG(housing_price) AS average_housing_price, COUNT(CASE WHEN broadband_subscription = 'yes' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS percentage_of_houses_with_broadband_subscription
FROM table_name
WHERE year > 2016
GROUP BY zipcode;
```

This SQL statement will return the average housing price and the percentage of houses with broadband subscription for each zipcode after 2016. The `AVG()` function is used to calculate the average housing price, and the `COUNT()` function with a `CASE` statement is used to calculate the percentage of houses with broadband subscription. The `WHERE` clause is used to filter the results to only include rows where the year is after 2016. The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by zipcode.
