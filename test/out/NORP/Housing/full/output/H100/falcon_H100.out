If more information is required, simply respond with 'INSUFFICENT'.

Note: The SQL statement should be in the form of a string.
To answer the question, we need to join the 'housing_gross_rent_percent' table with the 'demographic_basics' table on the 'zipcode' column. Then, we can calculate the change in average house rent from 2019 to 2022 by subtracting the 'number_of_units' column from the 'housing_gross_rent_percent' table for the year 2019 from the 'number_of_units' column from the 'housing_gross_rent_percent' table for the year 2022.

Here is the SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT 
    demographic_basics.zipcode,
    ABS(housing_gross_rent_percent.number_of_units - housing_gross_rent_percent.number_of_units) AS change_in_average_house_rent
FROM 
    housing_gross_rent_percent
JOIN 
    demographic_basics ON housing_gross_rent_percent.zipcode = demographic_basics.zipcode
WHERE 
    demographic_basics.year = 2019 AND housing_gross_rent_percent.year = 2022
```

Note: This SQL statement assumes that the 'housing_gross_rent_percent' table has columns 'year' and 'number_of_units' to represent the year and number of units for each zipcode, respectively.

Here is the SQL statement to answer the question:

```sql
SELECT 
    percentage_of_american_indian_and_alaskan_natives
FROM 
    (
    SELECT 
        ROUND(100 * COUNT(CASE WHEN race_total_populatio = 'American Indian and Alaska Native' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS percentage_of_american_indian_and_alaskan_natives
    FROM 
        demographic_race
    WHERE 
        year = 2022
    GROUP BY 
        zipcode
    ) AS subquery
ORDER BY 
    zipcode
LIMIT 1;
```

This SQL statement first calculates the percentage of American Indian and Alaskan Natives in each zipcode by dividing the count of American Indian and Alaskan Natives by the total population in each zipcode. It then selects the percentage of American Indian and Alaskan Natives from the subquery and orders the results by zipcode. Finally, it limits the results to the first row, which represents the zipcode with the highest percentage of American Indian and Alaskan Natives.
