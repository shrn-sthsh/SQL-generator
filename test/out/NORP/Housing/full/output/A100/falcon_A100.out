If more information is required, simply respond with 'INSUFFICENT'.

Note: The SQL statement should be in the form of a string.
To answer the question, we need to join the 'housing_rent' table with the 'demographic_basics' table on the 'zipcode' column. Then, we can calculate the change in average house rent from 2019 to 2022 by subtracting the'rent_value_min' column from the'rent_value_max' column for each zipcode in Atlanta.

Here's the SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT 
    zipcode,
    (rent_value_max - rent_value_min) AS change_in_rent
FROM 
    housing_rent
JOIN 
    demographic_basics ON housing_rent.zipcode = demographic_basics.zipcode
WHERE 
    zipcode = 'Atlanta'
```

Note: This SQL statement assumes that the 'housing_rent' table has columns'rent_value_min' and'rent_value_max' representing the minimum and maximum rent values for each zipcode, respectively. The 'demographic_basics' table has a column 'zipcode' representing the zipcode of each record.
