INSUFFICIENT

To answer the question, we need to join the 'la_crime_data' table with the 'crime_time' table and then group the results by the hour of the day. Here's the SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(Crime_Time, '%H') AS Hour,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Crimes
FROM 
    la_crime_data
JOIN 
    crime_time ON la_crime_data.Crime_Time = crime_time.Crime_Time
GROUP BY 
    Hour;
```

This statement selects the hour of the day from the 'Crime_Time' column, groups the results by the hour, and counts the number of crimes for each hour.
