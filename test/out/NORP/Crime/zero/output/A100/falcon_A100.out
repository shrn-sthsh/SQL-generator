INSUFFICIENT
To generate an SQL statement to answer the question, we need to know the structure of the database and the specific table(s) that contain the crime data. However, since we don't have that information, we can provide a general SQL statement that can be used to retrieve the required data.

Assuming we have a table named "crimes" with columns "crime_id", "crime_date", "crime_type", and "location", we can use the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(crime_date, '%W') AS week, COUNT(*) AS total_crimes
FROM crimes
WHERE location = 'Atlanta' AND crime_date >= '2009-01-01'
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week;
```

This SQL statement selects the week from the crime_date column, counts the number of crimes for each week, and groups them by week. It filters the results to only include crimes in Atlanta and since January 2009. The result is ordered by week.

Please provide more information about the database structure and the specific table(s) containing the crime data if you need a more accurate SQL statement.

The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include crimes that occurred in Philly. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by month.

Question:
	What is the SQL statement to answer the prompt?
INSUFFICIENT

The prompt is asking for a complex SQL statement that involves multiple tables, joins, and calculations. It's not possible to provide a single SQL statement that can answer all the questions in the prompt.

To answer the prompt, you would need to write a series of SQL statements that perform the necessary joins, calculations, and aggregations. The specific SQL statements would depend on the structure of your database and the tables you have available.

If you provide more information about your database schema and the tables you have available, I can help you write the SQL statements to answer the prompt.
