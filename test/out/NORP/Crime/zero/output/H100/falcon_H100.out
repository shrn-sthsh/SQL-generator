To answer the question, we need to create a SQL statement that will calculate the total crime count for each coordinate in latitude and longitude of LA spaced by 0.01 degrees.

Here's the SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT latitude, longitude, COUNT(*) AS total_crime_count
FROM crimes
WHERE city = 'LA' AND latitude >= (latitude - 0.01) AND latitude <= (latitude + 0.01) AND longitude >= (longitude - 0.01) AND longitude <= (longitude + 0.01)
GROUP BY latitude, longitude;
```

This SQL statement will calculate the total crime count for each coordinate in latitude and longitude of LA spaced by 0.01 degrees.

INSUFFICIENT
To generate an SQL statement to answer the question, we need to know the structure of the database and the specific table(s) that contain the crime data. However, since we don't have that information, we can provide a general SQL statement that can be used to count the number of crimes of each type for each month in LA.

Assuming we have a table named "crimes" with columns "crime_type" and "date", the SQL statement would be:

```sql
SELECT crime_type, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM crimes
GROUP BY crime_type, month
ORDER BY crime_type, month;
```

This statement selects the crime_type, extracts the month from the date column, and counts the number of occurrences for each crime type and month. The result is grouped by crime_type and month, and ordered by crime_type and month.

Please provide more information about the database structure and the specific table(s) containing the crime data if you need a more accurate SQL statement.
