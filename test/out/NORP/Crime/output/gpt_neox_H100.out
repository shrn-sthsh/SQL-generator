Prompt: 
	Give total crimes occurred in LA during each month of the year

Schema: 
	la_crime_data (Crime_ID, Report_#, Date_Reported, Crime_Date, Crime_Time, Crime_Type, Area_Name, Vict_Age, Vict_Sex, Weapon_Desc, Address, Latitude, Longitude)

Note, only respond with a single most accurate SQL statement.
If more information is required, simply respond with 'INSUFFICENT'.

RESPONSE 6:

Given the schema of the relavent database(s), generate an SQL statement to answer a question.

Prompt: 
	Give total crimes occurred in LA during each month of the year

Schema: 
	la_crime_data (Crime_ID, Report_#, Date_Reported, Crime_Date, Crime_Time, Crime_Type, Area_Name, Vict_Age, Vict_Sex, Weapon_Desc, Address, Latitude, Longitude)

Note, only respond with a single most accurate SQL statement.
If more information is required, simply respond with 'INSUFFICENT'.

Example:
	SELECT Crime_Date, COUNT(*)
	FROM la_crime_data
	WHERE Crime_Date BETWEEN '01/01/2015' AND '01/01/2015'
	GROUP BY Crime_Date
	ORDER BY Crime_Date

	SELECT Crime_Date, Crime_Time, Crime_Class, Crime_Type, Area_Name, Latitude, Longitude, COUNT(*)
	FROM nyc_crime_data
	WHERE Crime_Date >= '01/01/2015' AND Crime_Date < '01/01/2016'
	GROUP BY Crime_Date, Crime_Time, Crime_Class, Crime_Type, Area_Name, Latitude, Longitude
	ORDER BY Crime_Date, Crime_Time, Crime_Class, Crime_Type, Area_Name, Latitude, Longitude
	LIMIT 1

Expected Output:

PROMPT 25:

Given the schema of the relavent database(s), generate an SQL statement to answer a question.

Prompt: 
	For each coordinate in latitude and longitude of Atlanta spaced by 0.01 degrees, give the most common crime type and its count

Schema: 
	atlanta_crime_data (Crime_ID, Report_#, Day_Occurred, Crime_Date, Crime_Time, Crime_Type, Area_Name, Address, Longitude, Latitude)

Note, only respond with a single most accurate SQL statement.
If more information is required, simply respond with 'INSUFFICENT'.

RESPONSE 25:

Given the schema of the relavent database(s), generate an SQL statement to answer a question.

Prompt:

If more information is required, simply respond with 'INSUFFICENT'.

Output:
	SELECT Crime_Type, COUNT(*) FROM atlanta_crime_data WHERE (Longitude BETWEEN -84.5 AND -84.4) AND (Latitude BETWEEN 33.5 AND 33.6) GROUP BY Crime_Type;

Note, the above SQL statement is not the most accurate SQL statement.

Hint:
	The most accurate SQL statement is:
	SELECT Crime_Type, COUNT(*) FROM atlanta_crime_data WHERE (Longitude BETWEEN -84.5 AND -84.4) AND (Latitude BETWEEN 33.5 AND 33.6) GROUP BY Crime_Type;

## Hints

- You can use the `WHERE` clause to filter the data.
- You can use the `GROUP BY` clause to group the data.
- You can use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the data.
- You can use the `LIMIT` clause to limit the number of rows returned.
- You can use the `JOIN` clause to join tables.

PROMPT 49:

Given the schema of the relavent database(s), generate an SQL statement to answer a question.

Prompt: 
	Give count of each crime type for each hour of the day in LA.

Schema: 
	la_crime_data (Crime_ID, Report_#, Date_Reported, Crime_Date, Crime_Time, Crime_Type, Area_Name, Vict_Age, Vict_Sex, Weapon_Desc, Address, Latitude, Longitude)

Note, only respond with a single most accurate SQL statement.
If more information is required, simply respond with 'INSUFFICENT'.

RESPONSE 49:

Given the schema of the relavent database(s), generate an SQL statement to answer a question.

Prompt: 
	Give count of each crime type for each hour of the day in LA.

Schema: 
	la_crime_data (Crime_ID, Report_#, Date_Reported, Crime_Date, Crime_Time, Crime_Type, Area_Name, Vict_Age, Vict_Sex, Weapon_Desc, Address, Latitude, Longitude)

Note, only respond with a single most accurate SQL statement.
If more information is required, simply respond with 'INSUFFICENT'.

Example:

```sql
SELECT Crime_Type, COUNT(Crime_Type)
FROM la_crime_data
WHERE Crime_Date = '2019-01-01'
GROUP BY Crime_Type
ORDER BY Crime_Type;
```
