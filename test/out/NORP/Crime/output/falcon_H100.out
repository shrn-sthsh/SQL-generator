Please provide the SQL statement in the following format:

SQL Statement:
```sql
SELECT 
    Day_Occurred,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Crimes
FROM 
    atlanta_crime_data
GROUP BY 
    Day_Occurred
```

This SQL statement will give you the total number of crimes that occurred in Atlanta on each day of the week. It does this by using the COUNT function to count the number of crimes that occurred on each day, and then grouping the results by the Day_Occurred column.

FROM 
    atlanta_crime_data
GROUP BY 
    MONTH(Crime_Date)
```

This SQL statement will give you the total number of crimes that occurred in Atlanta during each month of the year. It does this by using the MONTH() function to extract the month from the Crime_Date field, and then grouping the results by this field. The COUNT() function is then used to count the number of rows in each group, which gives us the total number of crimes for each month.

```

This SQL statement will give you the total number of crimes occurred in Atlanta at each hour of the day. It does this by selecting the Crime_Time and counting the number of crimes for each hour, then grouping the results by Crime_Time and ordering them by Crime_Time.

====================================================================================================

PROMPT 4:

Given the schema of the relavent database(s), generate an SQL statement to answer a question.

FROM 
    atlanta_crime_data
WHERE 
    Crime_Date >= '2009-01-01'
GROUP BY 
    Week
```

This query counts the number of crimes in Atlanta for each week since January 2009. It does this by grouping the data by the week of the crime date (using the `DATE_FORMAT` function to extract the week from the date) and then counting the number of crimes in each group.

```

This SQL statement will give you the total number of crimes that occurred in LA on each day of the week. It does this by selecting the Crime_Date and counting the number of rows for each date. The WHERE clause filters the data to only include crimes that occurred in LA. The GROUP BY clause groups the data by Crime_Date, so that the count is calculated for each day of the week.

Given the schema of the relavent database(s), generate an SQL statement to answer a question.

Prompt: 
	Give total count of crimes in Philly grouped by week

Schema: 
	philly_crime_data (Crime_ID, Report_#, Crime_Date, Crime_Time, Crime_Type, Area_#, Address, Longitude, Latitude)

Note, only respond with a single most accurate SQL statement.
If more information is required, simply respond with 'INSUFFICENT'.

INSUFFICIENT
To answer the question, we need to group the data by week and count the number of crimes in each group. Here's the SQL statement to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(Crime_Date, '%W') AS Week, COUNT(*) AS Total_Crimes
FROM philly_crime_data
GROUP BY Week;
```

This statement uses the `DATE_FORMAT` function to extract the week number from the `Crime_Date` column and groups the data by that value. The `COUNT(*)` function is used to count the number of crimes in each group.

```

This SQL statement will return the total crime count, last reported date of any crime, the type of crime, the most common crime type, and the weekly increase in crimes by percentage for each area of Atlanta.

Note: This SQL statement assumes that the 'Crime_Date' column is in the format of 'YYYY-MM-DD'. If it's not, you'll need to adjust the date format accordingly.

INSUFFICIENT
The SQL statement to answer the question would be:

```sql
SELECT Crime_Type, COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM atlanta_crime_data
WHERE Latitude >= 33.749 AND Latitude <= 33.75 AND Longitude >= -84.388 AND Longitude <= -84.379
GROUP BY Crime_Type
ORDER BY Count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This SQL statement will return the most common crime type and its count for each coordinate in latitude and longitude of Atlanta spaced by 0.01 degrees. The WHERE clause filters the data to only include records with a latitude between 33.749 and 33.75 and a longitude between -84.388 and -84.379. The GROUP BY clause groups the data by crime type, and the COUNT function counts the number of records in each group. The ORDER BY clause sorts the groups by count in descending order, and the LIMIT clause limits the result to the top group.

The SQL statement to answer the prompt would be:

```sql
SELECT Latitude, Longitude, SUM(Crime_Count) AS Total_Crime_Count
FROM atlanta_crime_data
WHERE Latitude >= 33.749 AND Latitude <= 33.75 AND Longitude >= -84.388 AND Longitude <= -84.379

This SQL statement will return the latitude and longitude coordinates of Atlanta, and the total crime count for each coordinate, spaced by 0.01 degrees.

Schema:

Example:
	Input: "What is the total crime count for each coordinate in latitude and longitude of LA spaced by 0.01 degrees?"
	Output: "SELECT Latitude, Longitude, COUNT(*) FROM la_crime_data GROUP BY Latitude, Longitude"
To answer the question, we need to calculate the total crime count for each coordinate in latitude and longitude of LA spaced by 0.01 degrees.

The SQL statement to achieve this is:

SELECT Latitude, Longitude, COUNT(*)
FROM la_crime_data
GROUP BY Latitude, Longitude

This statement selects the latitude, longitude, and count of crimes from the la_crime_data table. The GROUP BY clause groups the results by latitude and longitude, allowing us to calculate the total crime count for each coordinate.

Please provide the schema of the relevant database(s) if you have any specific requirements or additional information.

The SQL statement is correct and efficient. However, it would be helpful to include comments for clarity.
Sure, I can add comments to the SQL statement for better understanding. Here's the commented version:

```sql
-- This SQL statement selects the latitude, longitude, and count of crimes
-- from the la_crime_data table.
-- The GROUP BY clause groups the results by latitude and longitude,
-- allowing us to calculate the total crime count for each coordinate.

SELECT Latitude, Longitude, COUNT(*)
FROM la_crime_data
GROUP BY Latitude, Longitude;
```

This statement will return the total crime count for each coordinate in latitude and longitude of LA spaced by 0.01 degrees.

The 'DATE_FORMAT' function is used to extract the day of the week from the 'Crime_Date' column.
