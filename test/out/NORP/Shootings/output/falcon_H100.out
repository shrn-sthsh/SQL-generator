Note, only respond with a single most accurate SQL statement.
If more information is required, simply respond with 'INSUFFICENT'.

Please provide the SQL statement.
INSUFFICIENT

The prompt does not provide the necessary information to generate an SQL statement. The schema provided only includes the 'experiencing_homelessness_age_demographics' table, but it is not clear what the other tables are or how they are related. Additionally, the prompt does not specify which database the schema is for, so it is not possible to generate an SQL statement without more information.

PROMPT 8:

Given the schema of the relavent database(s), generate an SQL statement to answer a question.

Prompt: 
	Get count of suspects arrested each month over the years.

Schema: 
	us_shootings (IncidentID, Address, IncidentDate, State, CityOrCountry, VictimsKilled, VictimsInjured, SuspectsInjured, SuspectsKilled, SuspectsArrested)

Note, only respond with a single most accurate SQL statement.
If more information is required, simply respond with 'INSUFFICENT'.

RESPONSE 8:

Given the schema of the relavent database(s), generate an SQL statement to answer a question.

Prompt: 
	Get count of suspects arrested each month over the years.

Schema: 
	us_shootings (IncidentID, Address, IncidentDate, State, CityOrCountry, VictimsKilled, VictimsInjured, SuspectsInjured, SuspectsKilled, SuspectsArrested)

Note, only respond with a single most accurate SQL statement.
If more information is required, simply respond with 'INSUFFICENT'.

Example: 
	Input: 
	Schema: 
	us_shootings (IncidentID, Address, IncidentDate, State, CityOrCountry, VictimsKilled, VictimsInjured, SuspectsInjured, SuspectsKilled, SuspectsArrested)
	Output: 
	SELECT COUNT(SuspectsArrested) AS ArrestCount, DATE_FORMAT(IncidentDate, '%Y-%m') AS Month
	FROM us_shootings
	GROUP BY Month
	ORDER BY Month

Explanation: 
	This SQL statement groups the data by month and counts the number of suspects arrested for each month.
	The DATE_FORMAT function is used to extract the year and month from the IncidentDate field.
	The result is then ordered by month.
