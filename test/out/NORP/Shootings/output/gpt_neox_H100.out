PROMPT 4:

Given the schema of the relavent database(s), generate an SQL statement to answer a question.

Prompt: 
	Get homeless population per capita for each county of California.

Schema: 
	experiencing_homelessness_age_demographics (CALENDAR_YEAR, LOCATION, AGE_GROUP_PUBLIC, EXPERIENCING_HOMELESSNESS_CNT)
us_population_county (PopulationCount, County)

Note, only respond with a single most accurate SQL statement.
If more information is required, simply respond with 'INSUFFICENT'.

PROMPT 8:

Given the schema of the relavent database(s), generate an SQL statement to answer a question.

Prompt: 
	Get count of suspects arrested each month over the years.

Schema: 
	us_shootings (IncidentID, Address, IncidentDate, State, CityOrCountry, VictimsKilled, VictimsInjured, SuspectsInjured, SuspectsKilled, SuspectsArrested)

Note, only respond with a single most accurate SQL statement.
If more information is required, simply respond with 'INSUFFICENT'.

RESPONSE 8:

Given the schema of the relavent database(s), generate an SQL statement to answer a question.

Prompt: 
	For each month, get count of victims killed and average of victims killed in each shooting incident.

Schema: 
	us_shootings (IncidentID, Address, IncidentDate, State, CityOrCountry, VictimsKilled, VictimsInjured, SuspectsInjured, SuspectsKilled, SuspectsArrested)

Note, only respond with a single most accurate SQL statement.
If more information is required, simply respond with 'INSUFFICENT'.

Example:
	For each month, get count of victims killed and average of victims killed in each shooting incident.

SQL:
	SELECT COUNT(VictimsKilled) AS VictimsKilled, AVG(VictimsKilled) AS AverageVictimsKilled
	FROM us_shootings
	WHERE IncidentDate BETWEEN '01/01/2015' AND '12/31/2015'
	GROUP BY IncidentDate
	ORDER BY IncidentDate

Expected Output:
	VictimsKilled	AverageVictimsKilled

PROMPT 13:

Given the schema of the relavent database(s), generate an SQL statement to answer a question.

Prompt: 
	For each state, get victims killed per million capita.

Schema: 
	us_population (CensurYear, State, PopulationCount)
us_shootings (IncidentID, Address, IncidentDate, State, CityOrCountry, VictimsKilled, VictimsInjured, SuspectsInjured, SuspectsKilled, SuspectsArrested)

Note, only respond with a single most accurate SQL statement.
If more information is required, simply respond with 'INSUFFICENT'.
