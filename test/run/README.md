## Run Directory

This directory contains the the run shell scripts used to batch jobs together for the NORP tests.  Note, running tests can be done in a single command,
but these bash scripts were made to batch jobs together on a cluster.


#### Hardware folders

This directory first splits scripts by what hardware they're run on.

#### Technique subfolders

It then splits on the tuning techniques used.
